# Patients-No-show-appointments-
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.


# Conclusions
1- There is not big difference between the distribution of Age between patients who showed up for the appointment versus the patients that did not show up for the appointment.
2- There is a higher percentage of people that received an SMS and did not show up when compared to people who received an SMS and did show up.
3- People that have a disease are 3% more likely to show up for the appointment than people who do not have a disease.
4- Handicap patients specifically,however, are more likely to show up to the appointment compared to people who are not Handicap.
5- Being enrolled in the Scholarship program does not seem to make people more likely to show up to the appointment.


# Limitations:
1- Most of our variables are categorical, which does not allow for a high level of statistical method that can be used to provide correlations etc
2- The statistics used here are descriptive statistics, not inferential, meaning that we did not create any hypotheses or controlled experiments or inferences with our data.
3- We do not have a lot of details for certain factors to draw conclusions. For the SMS_received example, the data shows that no-showers are more likely to receive an SMS. This may seem counter intuitive, but we do not have information on the conditions of when the SMS is sent. For example they may target No-showers with SMS, or they may send the SMS once the Patient has not checked in 30 minutes prior to their appointment etc.
4- Cannot show strong correlations between factors since most of our data is categorical.
